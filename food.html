				<h3> Congee </h3> 

				<p> Congee is a type of rice porridge that’s eaten in Asian countries. This is what my family and I grew up eating when we felt sick or unwell. It can be cooked plain or you can add different meats and vegetables to your liking. Growing up, I remember eating congee on the weekends made by my grandmother. She would add minced pork and century eggs. The warm feeling that runs through your body after taking a hot spoonful makes it a great dish for when you’ve got a cold. </p>

				<p> Making congee is easy, there are plenty of tutorials online and it doesn’t require many ingredients. I’ve made congee in a mini rice cooker before but it is typically made in a pot. </p>

				<h3> Honey Lemon Tea </h3>

				<p> I like drinking and eating hot/warm items when I’m sick. It provides temporary relief to your coughing phase and it helps with an upset stomach. You can’t go wrong drinking honey lemon tea. You can also spruce it up by adding ginger to the tea. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/cough/expert-answers/honey/faq-20058031">benefits</a> to drinking honey lemon tea when you’re sick. </p>
