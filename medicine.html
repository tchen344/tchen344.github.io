				<h3> ZzzQuil </h3> 

				<p> Although lots of people have DayQuil and Nyquil lying around in their home and occassionally drink it when they’re sick, it takes people a while to realize that DayQuil and Nyquil doesn't work fast enough. Sure, it helps you get better within a week or two, but wouldn’t you want to get better in 3 days? Personally, I have found that ZzzQuil not only knocks me out to give me a good night’s rest, but it also makes sure I get better within three days. No more sniffles and no more coughs. </p>

				<h4> How did I discover this? </h4>

				<p> During the first month of my freshman year, I caught the cold from my two roommates. I had bought ZzzQuil prior coming to college because it was on sale in Costco. While my roommates took DayQuil and NyQuil, I took ZzzQuil in hopes of getting better. After feeling a lot better in 3 days, I noticed that my roommates were still sick, so I offered them some. In the end, neither of them took some of the ZzzQuil and one of my roommates was sick until the end of the semester. </p>

				<p> You can purchase ZzzQuil on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vicks-ZzzQuil-Nighttime-Warming-Liquid/dp/B007MB5XTS">Amazon</a>. </p>

				<h3> Liquid Works Better </h3>

				<p> If you don’t have access to ZzzQuil, then DayQuil and NyQuil are still great options. I’ve taken both the pill versions and the liquid versions of both medicine and have realized that liquid works faster. </p>
