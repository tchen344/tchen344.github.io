				<h2> Why do we get sick around exam season? </h2>

				<p> We typically get sick around exam season because that's when we're experiencing the most stress. As humans, we go through different stages of stress. These stages are outlined by the <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/general-adaptation-syndrome#definition">General Adaptation System</a> theory. </p> 

				<dl>
					<dt style="font-weight: bold;"> Alarm Reaction Stage </dt>
					<dd>The first stage of stress is the alarm reaction stage, where your body realizes the amount of stress hormones present and energizes you to do something about it. </dd>

					<dt style="padding-top: 15px; font-weight: bold;"> Resistance Stage </dt>
					<dd> The second stage of stress is the resistance stage, where your body is fighting the stress hormones. </dd>


					<dt style="padding-top: 15px; font-weight: bold;"> Exhaustion Stage </dt>
					<dd>The last stage is the exhaustion stage, which is also the part where we get sick. Your body can't fight the stress anymore and you're mentally, physically, and emotionally drained. Your immune system is weakened and now you're sick. </dd>
				</dl>

				<p> So if you hear a lot of sniffling and coughing during your exams, now you know that those people have been coping with <i>a lot</i> of stress lately. </p>
